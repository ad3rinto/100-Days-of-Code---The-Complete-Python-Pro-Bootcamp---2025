# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# The print statement is not working, Should be printing "You got it"

# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# the for loop is meant to loop from 1 to 20

# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# Meant to print when the iterative is equal to 20

# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# assumption is that i will reach 20 on it's last run
